# Google Maps API for Business Binding

This is a binding project for the [Google Maps API for Business][1].

To build this set of binding libraries run make form the extern directory.

Then open the binding/android/GoogleMaps.M4B.sln solution file and build.

The samples/android/GoogleMapsSample/Properties/AndroidManifest.xml file requires a change to 'com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY' for your key.
