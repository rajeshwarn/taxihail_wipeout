You will need to pass in an instance of `PaymentViewControllerDelegate` to the constructor so you can handle when a card is scanned, or the user has cancelled scanning.\n\n```\n// Create the delegate to handle events\nvar paymentDelegate = PaymentViewControllerDelegate();\npaymentDelegate.OnScanCompleted += (viewController, cardInfo) =\u003e {\n\n\tif (cardInfo == null) {\n\t\tConsole.WriteLine(\"Scanning Canceled!\");\n\t} else {\n\t\tConsole.WriteLine(\"Card Scanned: \" + cardInfo.CardNumber);\n\t}\t\n\t\n\tviewController.DismissViewController(true, null);\n};\n\n// Create and Show the View Controller\nvar paymentViewController = new PaymentViewController(paymentDelegate);\n\n// Set the App Token - Use your own!\npaymentViewController.AppToken = \"YOUR-APP-TOKEN\";\n\n// Display the card.io interface\nPresentViewController(paymentViewController, true);\n```\n","Hash":"dc6efe69438b319ee3f4dc0f000602e9","TargetPlatforms":["ios"],"TrialHash":null}
