	Address the majority of the items in the LuxuryHail Issues document.
	
	1: For trips using the luxury service, the user's preferred Tip Amount (configured in the payment form) will be ignored since the tip is built into the fare for Luxury.
	2: The Vehicle type on the driver assignment screen is now being displayed. User should not be able to select the vehicle type for Luxury.
	3: On the Confirm Order screen, the destination address control displayed when fare breakdown is expanded. There are probably other pending features, but this was the main one that was derived from the last demo.
	4: Vehicle icons on map now render differently based on taxi and luxury service selection.
	5: fare icon, the map now centers on the moving vehicle when in trip.
	6: Vehicle type on the trip history details screen is now being displayed.
	7: Promotions are now working when configured using the company settings.
	8: 15 minute no show timer. After 10 mintues, a no show warning is sent to the user. After 15 minutes, the driver can request a no show and if approved, the user is charged a $15.00 no show fee and gets a receipt by email.
	9: 10 minute no show warning is sent as a push notification as well as a warning message on the booking screen.
	10: No show receipt is sent after No Show is approved, payment is processed.
	12: Gratuity screen will now only stay up for a configurable number of minutes (120). Note that the additional gratuity has been disabled in this build, so this feature will not be verifyable.
	14: The phone number linked to the call button should now change according to the service that is selected. The phone numbers are configurable in the company settings (DB).
	15: on trip complete for taxi service, you can now submit the rating and go back to the order screen.
	16: TAX-39 change tip while in car taxi fleet not working, MearsLuxury only for now, and for Taxi service only.
	17: TAX-48 remove apcurium logos, MearsLuxury only for now
	18: fleet tokens miss matched with luxury/taxi service types
	19: ChargeAmountsTimeout is now working, able to process payment form in DirveLinQ.
	20: Call button width should be reasonable now on iOS when no other buttons are visible on the bottom button bar. Previously the width of the button would shrink down to the width of the Call letters and was too small.
	21: When user clicks to expand the rate breakdown control, the Destination Address control should be made visible.
	22: Push notification is being sent when vehicle is in proximity to the pickup address.
	24: On the email receipt, the drop-off date/time should be in local time (not UTC), have to configure the timzeone in company settings to make this work.
		
	Known Issues:
	For item 21, the toggle will also hide the destination address control when clicked multiple times.
	
	PLEASE NOTE: There are a number os T-SQL scripts that must be executed when this build is released. The script will be provided to Scott & Pascal ahead of release time. The T-SQL script should be executed on the MearsLuxury database.
	
	PLEASE NOTE: There is a dependency on some IBS web service changes.
	Please ensure that the changes are pushed to this location prior to building the Middleware and the Mobile apps:
	http://mdsibs.mears.com:43550/IBScab/IBScab.dll/wsdl/IWEBOrder_7
	For the purposes of testing, we were using this end point which had the required changes:
	http://10.10.1.115:80/LAMP/IBSCab.dll/wsdl/IWEBOrder_7
	The IBS change is to expose a new class called TOrderStatus_6 which populates the VehicleType property.
	
0.5.7
	Thursday July 26, 2016
	Web Service URL for IBS was defaulting to the value stored in Config.AppSettings instead of Config.ServiceTypeSettings in some instances.
	The code that called GetOrderStatus from IBS was only using one of the fleets, now getting status updates from both Luxury and Taxi fleets.
	Added a null check for the VehicleType coming back from IBS Order Info.
	
0.5.8
	Monday August 8, 2016
	Fixed map moving north every 10 seconds on certain job statuses
	Cleaned up using statements
	Fix one remaining issue for TAX-39 tip calculation when changing the tip percentage while in trip

	Added null check on private member to try to solve some of the android debugging crashes	
	Address issues related to Extra amount oulined in an email from Mark Symmonds. When Extra amount is speficied in DriveLinQ, the value is now displayed on the receipt as Extra charge, history report shows extra amount, admin portal shows extra amount in order history report.
	For the 10 minute no show warning, always send both a SMS and a push notification message.
	Addressed 10 issues outlined in the LuxuryHail Issues.doc document:

		1. Luxury vehicles are not showing on map.  I booked into DriveLinq so I should show up on the app map.
		2. No gratuity to be applied on luxury transactions unless user explicitly taps the percentage button at the end of the trip.  Gratuity is automatically included in the rates.  As such tip button should also not appear during the trip on map screen for luxury fares
		3. The top portion of the Confirm screen should be cleaned up. It should be clear to the user which options can be edited during the booking process and which items require the user to go back to the “Payment” or “Update Account” sections. Also, the edits options should be pre-defined - this still needs to be done
		4. The icon of the vehicle on the map should reflect the type of vehicle assigned
		5. Once picked up the fare icon remains stuck at the origin on the map while the vehicle moves away
		6. Order details screen needs to show the type of vehicle used for that order - currently not displaying any vehicle type
		7. Not able to enter promotions for either luxury or taxi.  Carryover from TaxiHail functionality missing in LuxuryHail
		8. Once the driver arrives on scene and GPS is able to determine that the driver is on site, a 15 minute “no-show” timer will begin. If the fare is a future reservation, the 15 minute clock will begin at the reservation pickup time 
		9. If the passenger has not arrived for pickup within 10 minutes, a push notification and text will go out with a warning. If the passenger is in the app, a warning message will appear in the app. The push notification or message will state “Your vehicle has been waiting for ten minutes. Please contact the driver if you would like your vehicle to wait longer.”  
		Did not receive any notifications after 10 minutes.  DriveLinq Tom Tom is sitting right next to app, so I should be in the vicinity
		10. After 15 minutes the driver may request a “No show” and if granted, the user will be assessed a $15.00 no show fee - not able to test since other pieces are not working
